# 🦷 AI Voice Dental Assistant  

An AI-powered **voice-first assistant for dentists and patients**, built to reduce administrative stress for dental professionals and make dental visits more human, engaging, and efficient.  

This project uses **Vapi for AI voice**, **Prisma + Neon** for the database, **Next.js 15** for the frontend, **Shadcn + Tweackcn** for theming, **Clerk** for authentication & pricing, and **Tailwind v4** for styling.

## 🌟 Vision  

Dentists spend too much time on screens, patients often feel unheard.  
This project aims to change that by building a **voice-enabled assistant** that:  
- Gives dentists more **time with patients** instead of paperwork.  
- Makes patients feel **listened to** (literally).  
- Keeps the **human touch** intact, while automating workflows in the background.
